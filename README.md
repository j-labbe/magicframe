Ever wonder how long it takes to get home? What about the weather for the week?

Now you can see all of that and more with MagicFrame!

MagicFrame is a display that displays the time, weather, and traffic information. It is built using a Raspberry Pi, a 7" E-Ink display, and an IKEA frame.

## Notes
This is a first version. There are a few things that I would like to improve, including the modularization of the code. I would also like to add more features, such as a calendar, a to-do list, and the ability to create your own modules and add them to the display.
